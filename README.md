Introduction

The Movie Genre Prediction Project aims to create an automated system capable of predicting the genre of a movie based on its plot summary. This can be particularly useful for movie recommendation systems, content categorization, and improving search functionality in movie databases.
Features

    Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess movie plot summaries to prepare them for model training.
    Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from text data using NLP techniques.
    Model Training: Train various machine learning models, including neural networks, to predict movie genres.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    Prediction API: Provide a simple API for predicting movie genres given a plot summary.

Technologies Used

    Python
    Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    Machine Learning
    Scikit-learn
    TensorFlow / Keras
    Pandas
    NumPy

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-genre-prediction.git
cd movie-genre-prediction

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Prepare the dataset by placing it in the data/ directory.
    Run the data preprocessing script:

    bash

python preprocess_data.py

Train the model:

bash

python train_model.py

Evaluate the model:

bash

python evaluate_model.py

Use the prediction API to predict genres for new movie plots:

bash

    python predict_genre.py --plot "A group of friends embark on a journey to find a hidden treasure."

Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of movie plot summaries and their corresponding genres. Ensure that the dataset is in a CSV format with the following columns:

    plot: The plot summary of the movie.
    genre: The genre(s) of the movie.

Model Training

The model training process involves the following steps:

    Data Preprocessing: Clean and tokenize plot summaries.
    Feature Extraction: Use techniques like TF-IDF to extract features from text.
    Model Training: Train machine learning models using the extracted features.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using standard classification metrics:

    Accuracy
    Precision
    Recall
    F1-score

These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing in predicting movie genres.
